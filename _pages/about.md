<a href='https://www.cvrobots.com/'>FRC Engineering Mentor</a> and tutor with a passion for intersection of software and hardware

Welcome to my corner of the Internet! I created this site to share all my interests, both technical and not technical. 

On the technical side, I attended UC Berkeley for my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Master's in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Controls Theory. Check out the <a href="/cv"> cv/résumé</a> page to learn more such as about my time at Tesla and Co-Foudning a YC company!

On the non-technical side, I have come to appreciate the arts over the years as a way of understanding the world. As a result, you can find collections of song covers and photographs. Original songs and other mediums to come!

Site is powered by Jekyll built on top of the <a href='https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/tree/master'> al-folio</a> template.
