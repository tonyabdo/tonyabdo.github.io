This is a super cool model created by derailed3d, file for which can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2536988). To learn about the painting process, check out my Han Solo blaster page. Some notes to point out:
- The chin and nose can mess up without supports. There's a remix that has supports built into model. I chose to cut model in half because I was worried of print failing and it allowed me to use supports from slicer.
- There is a logo on the bottom which I filled in with wood filler before painting which helped to add weight. You could also use Blender to remove the feature. If you want more weight, pause the print and add bb pellets in infill, but keep in mind that now your printer might skip steps.
