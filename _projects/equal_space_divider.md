Got this beautiful tool for drafting as a gift, but, being secondhand, there was no box for protection. As a result, I got to designing a case with the goal of being sleek yet protective. The case features:
- Asymmetric locating features to prevent tool from rattling around when placed in either side of case
- Ribs that double as stiffeners and interface to clamp down onto divider
- Sliding lock with detents to give tactile feedback
