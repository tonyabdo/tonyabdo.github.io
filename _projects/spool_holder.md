Originally, the spool of filament is mounted on the top for an Ender V2 which wouldn't work for me with my shelving setup. Fortunately, Elproducts (CHEP from YT) made a [side-mounted holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4309135) and Jrjmas [improved upon it](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4333835), but it still wouldn't work for me. With how they designed it, accessing the spool would be hard with all my printers next to eachother. As a result, I modified Jrjmas's design in Fusion to allow for easier access of filament and maximize nesting of several Ender printers. You can find my remix [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6010000).
