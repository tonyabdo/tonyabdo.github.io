Being one of my first 3D printing projects, I learned a lot about 3D printing and painting as I completed the gift for my dad. For instance, don't be lazy and put away your filament because PLA loves water ðŸ™„. Anyway, this was a fun project and if you want to do it too, files can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1915956) thanks to PortedtoReality on Thingiverse!
