Saw a video of one of these and was immediately captivated, so one summer in college I decided to build one. Perhaps you'll see it featured in some upcoming videos on YT ðŸ˜‰

<div  class="container-fluid" align="center" >
    {% include video.liquid path="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6oIC_EgapOQ?si=5obdbWYuiilP-PJE" width="560" height="315" title="YouTube video player" max-width="100%" class="embed-responsive-item youtube rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
