Recorded this song as a response to what Azerbaijan was doing in the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict in November 2020. You can read about my feelings regarding the situation on IG. That aside, this song really pulled on my heartsrings the first time I heard it on Toonami when I was a kid. Hope I did the piece some justice in this recording!
